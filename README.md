### acpm - Assetto Corsa Package Manager (0.0.2)

A (hopefully) simple way to help you manage your Assetto Corsa mods.

acpm is a little application that manages your Assetto Corsa packages (where a package is a plugin/mod/app/skin) and notifies you when the author releases an update.

Please exit Assetto Corsa before installing/updating any packages.

#### THIS IS A PROTYPE!
I threw this together in a few hours. I didn't want to spend too much time on it mainly because I wanted to see how well this would be recieved. I can easily see why developers would rather drive traffic to their site to download their mods. 

Don't judge me too harshly on my code - again PROTOTYPE.

Since this is a prototype, it should only be used by more experienced users.

#### Known Limitations
Since this is a prototype, it doesn't do a lot of things it probably should. Known limitations:
- No uninstall of packages.
- Updating packages overwrites any file that is in the zip. Not sure how that will play out.

### Issue Tracker
Please submit any and all bugs and questions about acpm and any requests for additional data for [acpmr](https://github.com/cmsimike/acpmr/).


## To Download
Click into the releases tab and download the one that most closely matches your config. Download and unzip the file and run Assetto Corsa Package Manager.lnk. You can put that directory anywhere for now. An installer and auto updater are long term goals.


## Contributions
I'd like to give special thanks to [OriginalSyn](https://github.com/OriginalSyn) for allowing acpm to figure out where Assetto Corsa is install automatically!
